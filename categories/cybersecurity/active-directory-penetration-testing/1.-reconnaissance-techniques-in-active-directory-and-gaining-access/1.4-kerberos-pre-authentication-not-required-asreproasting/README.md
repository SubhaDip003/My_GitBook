# 1.4 Kerberos Pre-Authentication Not Required (AsRepRoasting)

**Kerberos Pre-Authentication Not Required (AS-REP Roasting)** is an attack technique used in Active Directory when a user account has **pre-authentication disabled**. Normally, Kerberos requires users to prove their identity before receiving any authentication data, but if pre-authentication is turned off, an attacker can request authentication data without providing a password.

In this attack, the attacker sends a request to the Domain Controller for a specific user account that has pre-authentication disabled. The server responds with an **AS-REP (Authentication Service Response)**, which contains data encrypted using the user’s password hash. Since this response is encrypted with the user’s password, the attacker can take this data offline and attempt to **crack it using brute-force or wordlists** to recover the plaintext password.

AS-REP Roasting does not require valid credentials, making it useful in situations where only a username is known. Attackers often use a list of usernames to identify accounts with pre-authentication disabled and then request AS-REP responses for those accounts.

Once the hash is obtained, it can be cracked offline using tools like Hashcat. If successful, the attacker gains the user’s password, which can then be used for further access in the domain.

This attack is less common in real-world environments because disabling Kerberos pre-authentication is considered a weak configuration and is usually avoided. However, it is frequently seen in labs and CTF scenarios for learning and practice purposes.

Previously after enumerating [LDAP domain dump](../1.3-enumeration-with-netexec.md#domain-information-dump-using-ldapdomaindump) we find that the `alice.wonderland` user has "Don't Require PreAuth" permission set.

Now, we use these user to perform AsRepRoasting attack.
